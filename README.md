A quickie library for dealing with big integers.

## Why?
tl;dr... it's fun

There are several—many?—Project Euler problems that involve very large integers. While there are already plenty of much better Javascript big number libraries out there, using those makes solving some of those problems trivial, which sort of defeats the purpose. If I just want to check off baxes, I could just Google the answers.

## If you actually need to do real work...
...don't use this. Use [something else][1] instead.
